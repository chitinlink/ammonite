- rules:
  - Server staff have final say on all matters regarding moderation, regardless of what the rules say.
  - |
    Respect the Discord [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).  
    Violating these not only endangers the server but also the user accounts of everyone in it.
  text: |
    We do not have a strike system. Staff will simply kick you out of calls or even the server if you take it too far.
    
    Please contact staff about any concerns you may have.  
    You can use the <span class="command">/modmail</span> command which has an anonymous option.

- name: "Netiquette"
  rules:
    - Be polite and respectful, both of the people and the space.
  text: |
    For example:
    * If you're having an argument, de-escalate or deal with it privately.
    * Do not alienate people talking about things they like or are passionate about.
    * In general, avoid aggressive behavior.

    Please do your part to keep this server in good working order, too. Post pertinently in the right channels, make liberal use of message links, and finally avoid spamming unless you're in <span class="channel"># service-hatch</span>.

- name: "Staff Conduct"
  rules:
  - Staff cannot exercise their powers without good reason, and must provide an explanation if asked for one.
  - Staff is allowed to exercise their powers for fun once in a while.
  text: You may contact an Administrator to raise concerns regarding other members of staff.

- name: "Restricted Content"
  rules:
    - Avoid posting slurs, and tag them appropriately when you use them.
    - Sexual NSFW content (ie. porn) is not to be posted anywhere on the server.
    - |
      All other NSFW content belongs in the opt-in hidden channel <span class="channel"># cathouse</span>.  
      If you're not sure something belongs there, err on the side of caution and post it there.
    - Server members may ask for certain things to be tagged and we ask that you respect these requests once you're made aware of them.
  text: |
    If you tag something (as some rules ask you to), you're also expected to [spoiler it](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags-).

    The point of tagging content is to prevent certain people from seeing it.  
    It's not ideal if they can figure out what you're saying from context clues. For example:

    Bad  | Hey guys I was just out drinking some (alcohol) <span class="spoiler">beer</span>
    Good | (alcohol) <span class="spoiler">Hey guys I was just out drinking some beer</span>

- name: "New Users"

    * You must vouch for the person you want to invite.
    * We may deny the request.
    * We do not accept members under 18 years old.
      * Members caught lying about meeting the age requirement will be banned permanently.
