- name: "Conduct"
  rules:
    - |
      Mind the Discord [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
      Violating these not only endangers the server but also the user accounts of everyone in it.
    - If you're having a real argument with someone, either focus on de-escalation or deal with it privately.
    - No violent ideation ("I want to kill this person", etc)
    - Do not to alienate people talking about things they like or are passionate about -- If the topic itself makes you uncomfortable, say so, but do not interrupt it or disparage ("blast") it otherwise.
    - Don't spread internet rumors -- by and large it's unconstructive and unhelpful to the server atmosphere.
    - Avoid bringing up hot topics that exclusively derive from internet discourse.

    Please be polite.

    __If a moderator asks you to stop, please do.__  
    We don't hand out punishments here nor do we have a strike system. Our moderators will simply kick you out of calls or even the server if you take it too far.

    With that said, please assume our moderators act in good faith when they correct you.

- name: "Restricted Content"
  rules:
    - |
      This server is kept minor-friendly with the exception of the hidden channel <span class="channel">#manhole-cover</span>.  
      If you're not sure something belongs there, err on the side of caution and post it there.
    - You can post non-sexual NSFW content (eg. art with blood/gore) outside that channel to a reasonable degree, as long as it is spoiled and tagged appropriately.
    - Non-sexual NSFW content (eg. art with blood/gore) is allowed, as long as it is spoiled and tagged appropriately.
    - Some of our members may require content to be tagged with triggers and we ask that you respect these once you're made aware of them.
    - Tag your slurs, including on your profile. You will be warned once if you break this rule.
  text: |
    If you tag something (as some rules ask you to), you're also expected to spoiler it.

    Keep in mind that the point of tagging content is to prevent certain people from seeing it.  
    It's not ideal if they can figure out what you're saying from context clues.

    For example:

    Bad  | Hey guys I was just out drinking some (alcohol) <span class="spoiler">beer</span>
    Good | (alcohol) <span class="spoiler">Hey guys I was just out drinking some beer</span>

    Despite having some limitations, you're expected to use this method.

- name: "Moderator Conduct"
  rules:
  - Moderators will provide concise explanations for the deletion of anyone's posts where possible, for the sake of providing context for everyone involved.
  - |
    Moderators cannot exercise their powers beyond the extent of reasonable moderation.  
    Moderators should not remove posts without a tangible reason, mute or deafen members arbitrarily, move members in voice against their will, etc.
  - Moderators are allowed to break the previous rule for fun as long as everyone involved doesn't mind and they don't overdo it.
  text: Please PM an Administrator to raise concerns regarding moderators and their conduct.

- name: "New Users"
  text: |
    If you want to invite someone in, you're expected to vet for them. Basically, you're partly responsible for the behavior of people you invite, at least initially.

    With that in mind, please contact (ideally PM) a moderator if you want to invite someone.  
    The request will be passed on to the mod team, who will also do a small background check, and then can either deny the request or hand you an invite.

    All users, including you, join the server via this process.
