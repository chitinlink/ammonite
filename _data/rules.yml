- name: "Conduct"
  rules:
    - |
      Mind the Discord [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) and [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).
      Violating these not only endangers the server but also the user accounts of everyone in it.
    - If you're having a real argument with someone, either focus on de-escalation or deal with it privately.
    - Do not to alienate people talking about things they like or are passionate about.

    Please be polite.

    __If a moderator asks you to stop, please do.__  
    We do not have a strike system. Our moderators will simply kick you out of calls or even the server if you take it too far.
    
    If you have a problem, consider messaging a moderator about it.

- name: "Restricted Content"
  rules:
    - |
      This server is kept minor-friendly with the exception of the hidden channel <span class="channel">#cathouse</span>.  
      If you're not sure something belongs there, err on the side of caution and post it there.
    - Non-sexual NSFW content (eg. art with blood/gore) is allowed, as long as it is tagged.
    - Avoid posting slurs, and tag them appropriately when you use them.
    - Some of our members may require certain things to be tagged and we ask that you respect these requests once you're made aware of them.
    - |
      The rules in this section also apply to your public Discord profile.
      You will be warned if you break this rule.

    If you tag something (as some rules ask you to), you're also expected to [spoiler it](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags-).

    The point of tagging content is to prevent certain people from seeing it.  
    It's not ideal if they can figure out what you're saying from context clues. For example:

    Bad  | Hey guys I was just out drinking some (alcohol) <span class="spoiler">beer</span>
    Good | (alcohol) <span class="spoiler">Hey guys I was just out drinking some beer</span>

- name: "Moderator Conduct"
  rules:
  - Moderators will provide concise explanations for the deletion of messages.
  - |
    Moderators cannot exercise their powers beyond the extent of reasonable moderation.  
    Moderators should not delete messages without a reason, mute/deafen/move members arbitrarily, etc.
  - Moderators are allowed to break the previous rule for fun as long as they don't overdo it.
  text: Please contact an Administrator to raise concerns regarding moderators and their conduct.
