## Emoji

* {% include emoji.html e="friendyhappy" %} {% include emoji.html e="friendycool" %} {% include emoji.html e="friendysad" %} {% include emoji.html e="friendysuffering" %} by [Carter Amelia Davis](https://twitter.com/sweetstench/status/1375883914246381571), featured on [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-ir1Hus3ic) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfcRNFmsmuY).
* {% include emoji.html e="cbt" %} from the Maplestory 2 [**C**losed **B**eta **T**est](https://orangemushroom.net/2015/01/20/maplestory-2-cbt-begins-tonight/).
* {% include emoji.html e="husk" %} Someone on twitter ([source dead](https://twitter.com/lauramariehart/status/1271484942887813124)) found the original 3D smiley for [this (kym link)](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1027831-reaction-images) and applied a filter to it to achieve the same effect the printer had on it, resulting in a higher quality version. I made it transparent.
* The following emojis I have yet to write attribution for, but they also don't require it as far as I know. Bother me if you want a specific one added.
