## The Ammonite

<img style="max-width: 200px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ammonite.png">

The original photo comes from [this page](https://www.fossilera.com/fossils/13-wide-jurassic-ammonite-fossil-madagascar) -- I edited it to be transparent.

{% include emoji.html e="ammonite" %}{% include emoji.html e="gold" %} Emoji versions of the ammonite icon, the second one is edited to be gold.

I made it [transparent](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/880468064481722490/999437968609640448/husk_transparent.png), then added the default emoji skin tone to it.
